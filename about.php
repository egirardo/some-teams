            <p class="description">My name is Elsa Girardo and I am a web developer currently studying web development at Yrgo in Gothenburg, Sweden. I have worked alongside a team of developers as their business analyst for the last two years and have now decided to pivot to learning to code. I have created this website as an assignment for our class called "Some Teams". The assignment was to take the information provided to us in a multidimensional array that can be found <a href="https://github.com/egirardo/some-teams/blob/main/data.php">here</a> and create a website that displays all of the given data. I hope you enjoy the way that information has been laid out for you!</p>
