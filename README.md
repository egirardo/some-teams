# Some Teams Assignment
I have created a website that displays the teams from the UEFA Women's Champions League. On the homepage you can find the teams listed out visually using their logos and from there you can either click directly on the logo of the team you would like to learn more about or navigate to their information page through the drop down menu in the header.

## How It's Made:

**Languages Used:** PHP, CSS

Using the multidimensional array provided by my professor in data.php, I have built a website that displays all of the included information using PHP and CSS. I used the information in the data.php file to create dynamic webpages that populate for each team by creating the teams.php template and linking that to the data within the array. The dynamic pages can be accessed by either clicking the team icons on the home page or using the drop down menu in the header to select the team that you would like to learn more about. Chat GPT was not used in the creation of this website.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest thing I learned in this project was how to implement dynamic pages into a website using multidimensional arrays. It took a lot of trial and error, but it felt great to figure it out on my own. I have also gained a much stronger sense of confidence in CSS and my ability to arrange elements on a webpage to my liking.
